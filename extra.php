                This is a great club that I have been apart of, with many wonderful people! The club has a lot of east Asians in it, but they include people from all over.
                They have weekly meetings in which they like to to celebrate events and have yummy food at the meetings!

                The UVM Club Tennis team has many of my friends on it. As I have been playing tennis since I was three, and competitively since I was 6, I have always been drawn to 
                other people that play my sport. There are two teams, A and B, both teams that I am close to! I play on both A and B, by choice!
                A team has multiple tournaments over the couse of the year where we travel to different universities and play matches against them!

                <h2>Vermont Cynic Feature Writer</h2>
                <h4> 2022-2024</h4>
                <p>
                I write for the Cynic, a newspaper that has over 35,000 readers. 
                As I am from a different country and have experienced both the outside world and America, it allows me to have a unique perspective on the issues that stem from racism. 
                It also lets me serve as a spokesperson. I can relate aspects of my life to other Black, Indigenous, People of Color that have similar experiences to mine. 
                These papers aim to amplify their voices on UVMâ€™s campus. Feel free to click on the pictures to read!
