                <h2>Software Developer - Team Member/Lead</h2>
                <h4>ORCA-Verso UVM, September, 2023 - present</h4>
                <p>
                Using Flask and Python for the front end and SQL Lite for the backend to design and build an open source tool for conducting Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) research with participants. 
                The Interactive Management App will produce a flow diagram that helps a group of people solve a collective problem. 
                The app will take in a list of factors identified by research participants that affect a specific problem, in which I have created a factors page and am managing the nav bar.
                It will then work with participants to figure out the relationships between factors (things that impact their ability to act).
                An algorithm will then determine which factors should be addressed first, second, and so on in order for the group to meet their goals.
                This tool will be used in Thriving in Open Source Communities in Africa.

                <h2>Sales Representative / Cashier</h2>
                <h4> LL Bean, June 2022 - May 2023</h4>
                <p>
                LL Bean is an outdoor gear company that sells everything from kayaks to Thule products to coats. I helped the Finney Crossing store during start up, including building shelves and placing stands.
                I worked as a cashier, dealing with many returns and purchases, and was a top 10 salesman for the LL Bean Mastercard in the Williston location. 
                Worked all the positions in the store, from front door to working in the back unloading clothes and placing them in storage. Restocking and folding clothes were a daily responsibility, 
                and I have had multiple opening and closing shifts. My job was to know all products well, from camping equipment, shoes, clothes, and all techincal gear in between and advertise them.

                <p>
                Tom's Racket Shop was at a local fitness club, specializing in selling tennis rackets, pickle balls rackets, and all the gear neccesary within those two sports.
                I was a salesman for Tom, often acting as a cashier and a salesman by recommending specific rackets based off of playing styles. Stringing tennis rackets was a huge part of this job,
                and I would often get through 3-4 rackets a day in between customers. It was my job to be familiar with over a 100 rackets, knowing their pros and cons. Restocking and regripping all rackets 
                was another responsibility of mine, and I am proud to saw that I had regripped almost all display rackets by the end of my tenure there.
